There are high levels of illiteracy in Ghana and a lot of children are behind in their schooling if a comparison is made of children,their age and their abilities against say children in the UK. 

The idea of this program was to make it a bit more fun for kids to learn their ABC than just constantly reciting A to Z.

The code has been converted to Android using buildozer and the FREE app for Android phones is here:

The idea for the Android app is because prices for smart "android" phones are coming down; the app is aimed at parents of children in Ghana and other 3rd world Countries to use the app with their children of ages around 2-3 to start planting the seed of Alphabet sounds and an Anchor for the letter, such as the sight and sound of an animal whose name begins with a letter of the Alphabet.

The interesting bit of the code for me was to make sure sound clips are synchronized so one sounds clip starts as the preceding one ends, also that when the "press me" button is tapped by a user and currently playing sounds stop and the sequence to play sounds connected to the current image start playing.
